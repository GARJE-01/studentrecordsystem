<h1>Student Record System</h1>
<hr>
<p><strong>ðŸ“– Project Details:</strong><br>
Student Record System is a web-based application developed to simplify the process of managing and analyzing student performance data in real time. Built during a Web Hackathon, this system allows academic institutions to efficiently store, retrieve, and visualize studentsâ€™ academic records and progress.</p>
<p>The application features a user-friendly interface for data entry and quick record updates, and provides insightful visualizations like progress bars and summary statistics to help educators identify trends in student performance. The system also includes a secure admin dashboard where authorized personnel can view overall student data, generate reports, and take actionable decisions.</p>
<p>With its modular design and responsive layout, the Student Record System is scalable, easy to integrate into existing infrastructures, and offers a streamlined solution to the common pain points faced by educational institutions in tracking student progress.</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Student Record System is a full-stack web application built during a college Web Hackathon to help educational institutions manage student data and academic progress efficiently. It provides a centralized platform for entering, storing, updating, and analyzing student records while also offering visual summaries of student performance.</li>
  <li>In most traditional setups, student data is often scattered across spreadsheets, paper records, or outdated systems. This fragmented process makes it difficult to track individual progress, generate quick reports, or identify students who need support. Our system solves this by creating a unified, user-friendly platform that simplifies record-keeping and enables better data-driven decisions.</li>
  <li>The primary purpose of this project is to:</li>
</ul>
<p>Streamline student record management for educational institutions.</p>
<p>Provide clear visualizations like progress bars to help educators and admins monitor student performance.</p>
<p>Save time on administrative tasks like report generation, making processes faster and more transparent.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Project Requirements / Dependencies:</strong><br>
This project requires the following tools and dependencies to run successfully:</p>
<p>Node.js (v14.x or above) â€” Backend JavaScript runtime<br>
Express.js â€” Web framework for creating RESTful APIs<br>
MongoDB â€” NoSQL database for storing student data<br>
Mongoose â€” ODM library for MongoDB<br>
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) â€” Basic front-end interface<br>
Optional: Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development</p>
<p><strong>Where Are They Listed?</strong><br>
All the Node.js dependencies are listed in the package.json file under the dependencies and devDependencies sections. For the front-end requirements, check the index.html file and linked styles.css and script.js. If you want to quickly view or install all required packages, simply run:</p>
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

<h5>Steps</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Follow these steps to install and run the Student Record System locally:</li>
  <li>Clone this repository:<br><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentRecordSystem.git</code></li>
  <li>Navigate into the project directory:<br><code>cd StudentRecordSystem</code></li>
  <li>Install all dependencies:<br><code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Set up MongoDB: Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine, or use a MongoDB cloud service like MongoDB Atlas. Create a <code>.env</code> file in the project root and add your MongoDB connection string:<br><code>MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string</code></li>
  <li>Start the application:<br><code>npm start</code> (If using nodemon, you can also run <code>nodemon index.js</code> for automatic restarts.)</li>
  <li>Open the application in your browser at:<br><code>http://localhost:3000</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>ðŸš€ Usage Info:</strong><br>
Once the Student Record System is up and running, you can access it through your browser and manage student data easily.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Typical Use Cases:</strong><br>
âœ… Add New Student Records â€” Fill in a simple form to add new students along with their name, roll number, class, and other academic details.<br>
âœ… Update Existing Records â€” Search for a specific student using the search bar or filters and quickly update their information (e.g. grades, attendance, etc.).<br>
âœ… Delete Records â€” Remove outdated or incorrect records with a single click.<br>
âœ… Visualize Performance â€” View real-time progress bars or graphical reports for individual students to monitor their academic performance.<br>
âœ… Export Data â€” Generate a CSV or PDF file of all student records for sharing or offline record-keeping.<br>
âœ… Admin Dashboard â€” Authorized admins can log in to see an overview of all students, apply filters, and generate summary reports as needed.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸ§­ Example Workflow:</strong><br>
Login as Admin â†’ View dashboard summary of all students<br>
Add a new student â†’ Fill the form and save<br>
Update a record â†’ Search by student name, update grades<br>
